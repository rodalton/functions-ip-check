# functions-ip-check
We can use the JavaScript in this repository to determine the IP address of an IBM Cloud Functions Action. 

Get started by creating a new Action on IBM Cloud Functions. The Action should have a Node.js 10 runtime. Once the action has been created, copy the contents of the ip-check.js file into the 'Code' tab of the action. Save your changes and use the Invoke button to run the action. The IP address for you Cloud Functions Action will be displayed in the Results pane.
