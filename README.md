# Determine the IP of an IBM Cloud Functions Action
We can use the JavaScript in this repository to determine the IP address of an IBM Cloud Functions Action. 

To determine the IP of an IBM Cloud Functions Action
1. Creating a new Action on IBM Cloud Functions. Note: the Action should have a Node.js 10 runtime
2. Once the action has been created, copy the contents of the ip-check.js file into the 'Code' tab of the action
3. Save your changes and use the Invoke button to run the action

The IP address for your Cloud Functions Action will be displayed in the Results pane.
